## 🎯 Conclusion

### Prefect Advantages:
✅ **Faster execution** (1.11x faster = 11.2% faster)  
✅ **Faster overall** (2.89 seconds faster per run)  
✅ **Better for time-sensitive workloads**

### Dagster Advantages:
✅ **100% success rate** (same as Prefect)  
✅ **Slightly more consistent** timing (0.24s vs 0.32s std dev)  
✅ **Good error handling** and retry mechanisms  
✅ **Stable performance** across all runs

### Overall Assessment:

Both frameworks perform **very well** for this workload:
- **Prefect** is consistently faster (11.2% faster = 2.89s per run)
- **Dagster** has slightly more consistent timing (0.24s vs 0.32s std dev)
- **Difference is meaningful** but not dramatic (2.89 seconds = 11.2% faster)

For this specific use case (reading Parquet and writing to VictoriaMetrics):
- **If speed is critical:** Choose Prefect (slight edge)
- **If consistency matters:** Choose Dagster (slightly better)
- **If framework features matter more:** Consider other factors (UI, scheduling, etc.)
